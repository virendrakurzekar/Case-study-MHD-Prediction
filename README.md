# DASS-42 Mental Health Prediction API

A concise and robust FastAPI backend designed to process the 42 questions of the DASS-42 questionnaire along with 11 demographic features. It predicts the clinical severity classification of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress levels using an ensemble of saved machine-learning models.

## Features
- **Ultra-concise implementation**: Efficiently parses 42 individual items by dynamically routing subscale items to matching models via index mappings.
- **Robust against dimensionality mismatch**: Protects against unexpected user input shapes by parsing data exactly as the `.pkl` bundled models expect it (14 items + 11 demographic variables per model).
- **Easy deployment**: Simply start the server and push JSON payloads through standard REST methodology.

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Launch the Application
Run the API locally using `uvicorn`:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```
*Note: Make sure your `final_dass_system.pkl` is located in the root repository alongside the scripts.*

## API Endpoints

### 1. Health Check
`GET /`
Returns the status of the API and verifies if the Pickled models are successfully loaded in memory.

### 2. Perform Prediction
`POST /predict`
Accepts a structured JSON payload containing the 42 DASS answers + 11 demographics.

## DASS Answer Scale (0 - 3)
* 0 = Did not apply to me at all
* 1 = Applied to me to some degree, or some of the time
* 2 = Applied to me to a considerable degree, or a good part of time
* 3 = Applied to me very much, or most of the time
